# Character Prompt Generator
This is a simple HTML and JavaScript tool that generates random appearance and personal trait prompts for fictional characters. It also provides a prompt text template that can be used to write novel-like descriptions or introductions for the generated characters.

## Usage
To use the generator, simply click on the "Generate new appearance" or "Generate new personal traits" buttons to generate a random appearance or personal trait prompt, respectively. The appearance prompt includes eye and hair color, while the personal trait prompt includes characteristics such as hobbies, fears, and habits.

Once you have generated your prompts, use the template provided to create a novel-like introduction or description for your character. You can then copy the prompt text to your clipboard using the "Copy to Clipboard" button.

## Example Output
An example output of the character prompt generator can be found in the "example.html" file included in this repository. This example demonstrates how the prompts can be used to create a character description using an AI language model such as ChatGPT.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using the Pico CSS framework for styling, and uses JavaScript and Lodash library for generating the prompts and clipboard.js for copying the generated text to clipboard.

## Future Improvements
Potential improvements to this tool could include adding more prompt categories, such as background information or occupation, or allowing users to customize the prompts by selecting from a list of options.
